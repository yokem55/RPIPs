## Abstract
To ensure the long-term sustainability and continued innovation of the Rocket Pool protocol, this document lays out the high-level roles, responsibilities, processes, and funding for core protocol development.

## Related RPIPs
- [RPIP-10: pDAO Budget Allocation](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-10)
- [RPIP-24: oDAO Charter](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-24)
- [RPIP-25: RPL Inflation Allocation](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-25)

## Specification

### Prioritisation

- Each year, the Core Protocol Team MUST facilitate a prioritisation discussion with the Rocket Pool community.
- pDAO SHOULD engage in the prioritisation discussion to ensure development team prioritises are aligned with pDAO expectations.
- The Core Protocol Team MUST summarise findings of prioritisation discussion and communicate them to the pDAO.

### Roadmap

- The Core Protocol Team MUST define an indicative protocol roadmap or release schedule based on the prioritisation findings.
- The Core Protocol Team MUST provide quarterly updates on the roadmap.
- The protocol roadmap is expected to evolve over time, the Core Protocol Team SHOULD communicate these changes in the quarterly updates. 

### Governance

- The Core Protocol Team MUST draft Rocket Pool Improvement Proposals (RPIPs) for new protocol features.
- pDAO SHOULD engage in discussion and co-development of the new protocol features.
- In order for new protocol features to be included, they MUST be approved by a pDAO vote.

### Funding

- Each year, the pDAO MUST vote to agree a protocol development funding budget.
- On a successful vote, the pDAO MUST pay a lump-sum payment from the pDAO reserve to cover protocol development costs for the upcoming year.
- Protocol development funding is initially set to **5%** of RPL inflation.

### Process

- The Core Protocol Team SHOULD engage in continuous process improvement.
- The Protocol DAO (pDAO) SHOULD engage in providing feedback on the development process.
